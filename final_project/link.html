                    <p>The legend of Zelda series is another childhood favorite. My favorite one out the series is Majora's Mask. This game was awesome to play as a kid and I did revisit it when I got older. I enjoyed the overall story and the dark themes they used in this game. It's always so cool to think about the plot to this game and how much mystery there still is in this game. But as of right now I am patiently waiting for "Breath of the Wild 2" to come out since the storyline there is also cool. </p>
