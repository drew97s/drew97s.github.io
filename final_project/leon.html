                    <p>Resident Evil was a franchise I enjoy. I didn't enjoy all the Resident Evil games. But my favorite by far was Resident Evil 2. I even remember my parents playing it when I was kid. The games do tend to be linear, but they have great puzzles to solve to moe forward. The thing this franchise does well though is build a a sense of atmosphere and dread. </p>
