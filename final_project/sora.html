                    <p>Kingdom Hearts is by far my favorite video game franchise hands down. I enjoyed playing these games so much. Dealing with themes of light and dark. To having a complicated storyline that is to difficult to explain here. And the graphics are amazing and always got better with each passing game. The enemies you fought, ranging from being easy to hard. I could go on and on about how much I love this series. I could probably write pages about this game. But I can definetly say if you like role playing games you should definetly give Kingdom Hearts a shot.</p>
