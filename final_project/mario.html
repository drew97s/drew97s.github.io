                <p>Super Mario has been around my life ever since I was a kid. I have played Mario games on a bunch of systems starting from the Super Nitendo to Nintendo's current console, the Switch. I always had great times playing these titles because it is always linked to fond memmories. My favorite out of the franchise would have to be the classic "Super Mario 64" I have played that game the most and watched a bunch of videos of people speed running the game. Im always to see new Mario games being made or have the old game resold. Mario will always remind me of good times</p>
