                <p>You decided to be brave and go head first into the cave. You can't help but notice out of the corner of your eye. The bunny from earlier was there staring at you. You feel a chill down your spine as you continued forward. 
                    You can't see anything since its so dark. Do you contiue being brave and go forward, or do you call it a night and decide to go home?
                </p>
