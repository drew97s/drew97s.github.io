                <p>While heading towards the cave you hear wolves howling in the forrest. Its a good thing you didn't explore the forrest. You manage to come across a bunny who seems to be standing there... staring at you. You remember how much you love bunnies. Do you stop to pet the bunny or do you contine down the path to the cave.</p>
