        <p>Hi my name is Andrew and this is my portfolio for my class, MMP 210. Here you'll find the projects I'll make during the semester taking this class. For now though, since it's the begining of the semester, here is an artwork that I have worked on before for a differnet class. The image also links to an art instagram account that I'm currently working on. You can also click on my image to the left to visit my personal instagram, feel free to follow. </p>
