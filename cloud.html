                    <h1>Final Fantasy Series</h1>
                     <p>Final Fantasy has been wonderful franchise to have around. I love the creative creatures used in the series. I also love seeing the franchise grow from being pixels into 3D models. Final Fantasy was always so fun to play too. I can remember spending long hours infront of a tv, and leveling up my team to max level, just so I am over powered or trying to kill a super boss. Either way I had no problem with grinding to level up. </p>
