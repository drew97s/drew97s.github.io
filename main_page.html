                   This site was created to tell a story of my own. Revovling around game series I have played through my life, and how they have become apart of my life. I wanted to imclude so many games, but I have played a lot of games. So I chose 5 that first came to my mind. So with that intro being said, click on any of the characters to hear a brief short story of personal experience.
